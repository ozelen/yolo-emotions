# Facial Expressions Recognition
The Project is the combination of two models of Object recognition on a model found somewhere on the Internet and Emotion recognition, using YOLOv8 and [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/), by Mollahosseini. With the last I needed some time and patience to train the model, however, the dataset was good enough and fit the purpose.
